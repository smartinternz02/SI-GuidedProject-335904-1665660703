Credit Card Approval Prediction using IBM Watson Machine Learning
overview:
With the increasing number of credit card applications, banks are opting towards the use of 
prediction-based algorithms as opposed to manual approval methods. Data analysis has exhibited a 
strong correlation between several financial and personal factors of a client and the likelihood of said 
client complying with their respective bank's credit policies. In this paper, we propose the use of the 
Machine Learning algorithm to predict and grant credit cards to applicants based on the customers' 
activity history. We used some financial and personal factors. We predicted the resulting factors 
through the use of Machine Learning algorithm with an emphasis on error minimization. Using this 
Machine Learning model, the machine-learned which of these applicants are most likely to accumulate 
bad debts and granted or rejected the applications based on the prediction.
